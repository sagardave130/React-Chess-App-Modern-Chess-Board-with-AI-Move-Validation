# React Chess Application

This project is a simple and modern chess application built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The focus is on creating a smooth chess-playing experience with clean visuals, responsive design, and easy-to-understand game mechanics powered by `chess.js` and `react-chessboard`.

Whether you're experimenting with different openings, practicing tactics, or just playing casual games, this app offers a lightweight environment that's easy to run and extend.
